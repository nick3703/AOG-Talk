Drew Conway's Venn Diagram of Data Science

## Fundamental Questions{.build}

- What defines success in your business?
- How is this measured?
- What can serve as a proxy?

- Increase Funding -> Engagements from Website -> Clicks on Donate Button

## Fundamental Questions{.build}

- What decisions are you making?
- What data have you collected to support that decision making process?
- Until these questions are answered, data science can do little to help

## AB Testing

- Will changing my website layout impact the number of donations?
- Hypothesis: Placing button in middle will increase number of donations

## Data

```{r}
sample.data<-read.csv("click_data.csv")
sample.data<-sample.data %>% mutate(visit_date=mdy(visit_date))
summarized.data<-sample.data %>% group_by(month(visit_date))%>%
  summarise(avg=mean(clicked_adopt_today))
summarized.data
```

## Randomizing Experiment
```{r}
summarized.data %>% ggplot(aes(x=`month(visit_date)`,y=avg))+
  geom_point()+geom_line()
```

## General Technique{.build}
- Randomly assign visitors to one of `n` web pages
- Collect number of "successes"
- After designated time period determine if meaningful difference exists

```{r}
result<-prop.test(x=c(50,30),n=c(200,200),correct = FALSE)
result$p.value
```

## What do these mean?

- Remember we are tied to a decision here, does new webpage generate more donations/clicks?

- If you decide to switch to new webpage, there is a 1.3\% chance you are wasting your time

- Does not make decision for you, must factor in cost.  If new webpage costs double of old webpage that should be accounted for.

```{r}
result$conf.int
```


## Confidence Interval Analysis

```{r}
result$conf.int
```

- Out of 200 people, we would expect 4-35 more to engage with new webpage

- If each engagement is expected to bring in 1 doller (on average) and new webpage costs an additional 50 dollars a month to maintain, may not be worth it

## Warnings

```{r}
summarized.data %>% ggplot(aes(x=`month(visit_date)`,y=avg))+
  geom_point()+geom_line()
```
- Let's say trial is done in Month 9
- Does this necessarily mean our results are valid for December?
